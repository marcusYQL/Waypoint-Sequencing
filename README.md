Waypoint Sequencing


Overview

Waypoint Sequencing is a customer-driven program designed to empower individuals to select their preferred delivery times for parcels. The project was developed from August 2023 to December 2023 with the aim of enhancing the flexibility and convenience of parcel delivery services.


Objective

The primary objective of Waypoint Sequencing is to provide customers with the ability to customize their delivery schedules, thus offering greater convenience and control over the delivery process. This program seeks to optimize the last mile delivery experience by allowing customers to choose specific timeslots for parcel delivery.


Key Features

Customer Preference Selection: Customers can specify their preferred delivery times when placing orders.

Data Analysis: Relevant data was analyzed to uncover insights and trends regarding customer preferences and delivery patterns.

Prototype Development: Prototypes were developed to trial the program's backend functionality and assess the integration with existing delivery systems.

Last Mile Courier Utilization: The program focuses on optimizing the utilization of last mile couriers by efficiently sequencing delivery routes based on customer preferences.


Implementation

The implementation of Waypoint Sequencing involved several key steps:

Data Collection: Relevant data pertaining to delivery routes, customer preferences, and parcel volumes was collected.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Preliminary EDA was conducted to uncover insights and patterns in the data.

Prototype Development: Prototypes were developed to implement and test the backend functionality of the program.

Trials and Evaluation: The prototypes were trialed to assess their effectiveness in real-world scenarios and gather feedback for further refinement.
Future Development

User Interface Enhancement: Improving the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.

Integration with Delivery Platforms: Seamless integration with existing delivery platforms to streamline the delivery process.

Optimization Algorithms: Implementing advanced optimization algorithms to further enhance route sequencing and courier utilization.
